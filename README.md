# sign_language_dataset
**Dataset for my Sign Language Detection Project, for both TensorFlow Object Detection API and DeepQuest's DeepStack trainer.**

This repository contains my dataset annotated separately for TensorFlow OD API, which uses PASCAL-VOC XML format, and DeepQuest's DeepStack Trainer, 
which uses YOLOV format.

I used [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) to annotate for DeepStack Trainer, and I used Colab utils' annotate function 
to annotate for TFOD API.
